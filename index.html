                <p>The Adobe Creative Cloud team will host the Creative Jam presentations. 
                    This one-hour design showcase highlights the work of 3 creative leaders. 
                    At the same time, in the next room, hand-picked Designers will be competing 
                    in the Creative Jam tournament, a 3-hour design charrette showdown. 
                    Participants will be using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html">Adobe XD</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    Once the Creative Jam presentations wrap, tournament participants will take 
                    the stage to share their creations with you. As part of the audience, 
                    you’ll vote on each submission and select the People's Choice winner. 
                    There will also be Grand Prize winners decided by a group of judges!
